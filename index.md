Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. My primary field of interest is empirical industrial organization and quantitative marketing. I am also interested in health economics and behavioral economics. My research applies tools of empirical IO to topics such as sorting, vertical contracts, and spillovers across policy settings, including pharmaceuticals, transportation, electric vehicles, and digital platforms.
