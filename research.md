> We estimate an equilibrium sorting model of housing location and commuting mode choice with endogenous traffic congestion to evaluate the efficiency and equity impacts of a menu of urban transportation policies. Leveraging fine-scale data from household travel diaries and housing transaction data identifying
residents’ home and work locations in Beijing, we recover structural estimates with rich preference heterogeneity over both travel mode and residential location decisions. Counterfactual simulations demonstrate that even when different policies reduce congestion to the same degree, their impacts on residential sorting and social welfare differ drastically. First, driving restrictions create large distortions in travel choices and are welfare reducing. Second, distance-based congestion pricing reduces the spatial separation between residences and workplaces and improves welfare for all households when it is accompanied by revenue recycling. Third, sorting undermines the congestion reduction under driving restrictions and subway expansion but strengthens it under congestion pricing. Fourth, the combination of congestion pricing and subway expansion delivers the greatest congestion relief and efficiency gains. It can also be self-financed, with the cost of subway expansion fully covered by congestion pricing revenue. Finally, eliminating preference heterogeneity, household sorting, or endogenous congestion significantly biases the welfare estimates and changes the relative welfare rankings of the policies.

<details><summary markdown="span"> Abstract </summary>
> This paper studies how resale price maintenance (RPM), a vertical practice that allows upstream manufacturers to directly control downstream retail prices, affects welfare. This effect is theoretically ambiguous because RPM can increase consumer welfare by eliminating double markups, but decrease it by facilitating price coordination across competing retailers. I provide empirical evidence of these effects by examining a high-profile antitrust case involving a pharmaceutical firm that was found to practice RPM and ruled to stop. Difference-in-differences estimates using a novel retail pharmacy-level dataset suggest the net effect of RPM decreases retail prices and is pro-competitive in this setting. The results also suggest that RPM reduces retailer markups and suppresses price dispersion across retailers. These findings are consistent with manufacturers' incentives of using RPM to both eliminate the double markup and coordinate the retail price. I build and estimate a structural model to disentangle these incentives.
The model confirms that RPM is overall welfare-improving in this setting. However, the consumer surplus gain from RPM would have been 77% higher absent of price coordination incentives. In addition, I show that under different market conditions RPM can lead to anti-competitive outcomes.

<details><summary markdown="span"> Abstract </summary>
> Making innovative drugs affordable and accessible is a pressing global challenge. Centralized negotiation is an increasingly popular policy solution, but it remains understudied despite wide variation in implementation. This paper studies China's ongoing NRDL Reform, which combines centralized drug price negotiation with expanded insurance coverage. The reform reduced retail prices by 48% and out-of-pocket costs by 80%, and increased drug utilization by 350%. At the same time, the insurance design was regressive, and 25% of negotiations failed. Focusing on cancer drugs, we estimate a flexible demand and supply model that features heterogeneous households, bargaining with potential breakdowns, and a government objective function that depends on consumer surplus and insurance spending. We estimate that including innovative cancer drugs in the NRDL generated RMB 40 billion (\$5.6 billion) in annual consumer surplus gains and increased survival by 900,000 life-years among Chinese cancer patients each year. Among the counterfactual policies we examined, centralized market-access negotiation with an optimal coinsurance schedule raises social surplus by 19% relative to the observed policy and achieves 90% of the social surplus of an efficient benchmark.

<details><summary markdown="span"> Abstract </summary>
> A few top content creators capture most of the impressions on digital platforms, discouraging grassroots users from creating new content, and thereby threatening the platform ecology. This concentration presents a dilemma to the platform: whether a platform should capitalize on established content creators' popular content in the short run or promote content creation from amateurs in the long run. To quantify this tradeoff, I study a two-sided experiment by a short-form video platform that exogenously increases the impressions of treated amateur-generated content to treated viewers. Although viewer usage time decreased in the short run, the program successfully fostered the production of higher-quality and more diverse content from amateur creators. Overall, incentivizing amateur content creation offered net benefits to platforms in three months.

<p style="margin:0px 0px"> Range Anxiety. (with [Panle Barwick](https://panlebarwick.github.io/) and [Shanjun Li](https://shanjunli6.github.io/index.html/)) </p>
<details><summary markdown="span"> Abstract </summary>
> Range anxiety, the fear of depleting battery before reaching a charging station, is often cited as a major barrier to electric vehicle (EV) adoption, yet there has been limited formal economic analysis to quantify its importance and understand the policy implications. We develop a continuous-time dynamic model of EV usage and charging decisions to quantify range anxiety as the utility loss from feasible yet unrealized trips due to perceived range constraints. Using high-frequency data of 188,000 EV trips and 30,000 charging events among 8,000 EVs in Shanghai, we recover model parameters governing consumer driving and charging decisions. The estimates imply that, across EV models with varying driving ranges, average range anxiety was about $1,900 in 2021 but declined to $1,200 in 2024, driven by improvements in charging infrastructure and, especially, increases in driving range. Policy simulations underscore the importance of coordinating investments in battery capacity and charging infrastructure to address range anxiety: relative to socially optimal levels, Shanghai’s EV market has under-invested in driving range while over-investing in charging infrastructure.

From Free Rider to Innovator: The Rise of China’s Drug Development. (with [Panle Barwick](https://panlebarwick.github.io/) and [Hongyuan Xia](https://hongyuan-xia.github.io/)) </p>
<details><summary markdown="span"> Abstract </summary>
> This paper examines the transition of developing economies from pharmaceutical ``free riders'' to innovators, using China’s recent ascent as a case study. Since 2020, China has surpassed the US in its annual volume of registered clinical trials. By linking global clinical trial registries with granular drug sales data and scholarly publication data, we provide evidence that this shift was primarily driven by the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) reform. This policy shock increased the effective market size for innovative drugs by combining price negotiations with massive insurance expansion. We document a sharp rise in both the quantity (94% increase post-reform) and novelty of drug trials, with growth concentrated in reform-exposed disease categories, in novel drug development, and among domestic firms. A decomposition exercise shows that the NRDL reform accounts for 40\% of the growth in trial activity in the Oncology sector. Our results suggest that strategic public purchasing can simultaneously improve patient access and provide robust incentives for indigenous innovation.

<details><summary markdown="span">  External Effects of Procurement Auctions: Evidence from Chinese Centralized Procurement for Drugs </summary>

> In the market for medical goods and services, the intense involvement of the public sector creates a possible linkage between public-sector policies and private-sector outcomes. This study investigates the external effects of a centralized procurement auction policy on generic drugs in China, which creates a price shock (50% decrease on average) in the public sector. Leveraging the regional and timing variations, I find that the pharmacies' retail price response is much smaller (10%), indicating strong market friction. I build a structural model to quantity the welfare and provide evidence of consumer inertia and transportation costs as the main mechanisms that explain market friction. Firstly, patients that got diagnosed recently are more likely to switch, indicating strong inertia. Secondly, the price response is more significant for pharmacies closer to hospitals, consistent with high transportation costs.

**Welfare Analysis of a User-Generated-Content Supporting Program on a Short-video Platform**

> A few top content creators usually capture most of the impressions on digital platforms, discouraging grassroots users from creating new content and may threaten the platform ecology. Therefore Platforms are incentivized to support user-generated content (UGC) to improve the content pool, discover potential stars, and achieve better performance in the long run. I analyze an internal experiment in a short-video platform to quantify the effects of a supporting program on UGC. The program leads to worse viewer experience in the short run, measured by a six percentage-point decrease in the completion rates, but leads to more content posting and higher content quality. Furthermore, a model suggests that the gain from content quality can offset the loss of deviating from the short-run recommending algorithm within three months.

**Shopping Mall Externality** (with [Si Zuo](https://www.si-zuo.com/))

> Many papers show there exists the externality among shops within a mall or shopping street, but there is little study about how the externality changes across space and categories. Using the novel daily data of 380 stores in a large mall from 2016 to 2020, we identify the externalities from anchor stores using the anchor stores' promotional events. Such events draw more consumers to the mall and thus benefits the other stores. To deal with potentially endogenous promotional choices, we adopt a new IV: the promotional events of the other stores under the same chain in the same city. Then we show how the externalities vary across floors, distance, and store categories, which is unique to the existing literature. Finally, we use simulations to illustrate how rent contracts and store allocations could internalize the externalities among shops and provide managerial suggestions.
